In the worst case big O, Gale Shapely can be up to n^2 complexity. The algorithm itself,
if implemented properly, should never reach this bound, as women and men are constantly
being taking out of the equation and don't have to be considered. In my own code, I cut
down on time by utilizing dictionary data structures instead of lists, as dictionary
lookups are constant time (O(1)), while lookups in lists are O(n). In the lists I used,
I only search through the freeWoman list once, to see if she's available, but I chose to
use a dictionary of coupled matches because it heavily cut down the overall time spent.
